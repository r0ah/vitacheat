# Note:
# Yohoki:
#  - All items, Seal Stones and Master Rings codes
#  - Added several codes to your previous findings. Also found a few "x99 cards" codes for various cards, but I can't find a good way to get all cards unlocked. If I or someone else finds it, it'd be nice to have a short compressed code to get all cards unlocked.
#  - Also, your codes worked with US version (PCSE00373) (Vitamin). Not sure if they should be merged or separated. It's your database, sort it how you like.
