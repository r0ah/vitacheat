about: Submit your cheat code using this template

> **Note**: Do not forget to include the **Version** and **Type**! If you don't specify the version then I'll just assume it use the base version. If no type is specified I won't add your cheat code in the database until you specify the type in the issue comments.	

## Testing tour Cheat Codes ##

Before you submit your cheat code you have to test it in this condition:

1. Close the game's bubble to restart the game then test your codes 
2. Do a full shutdown of your PSVita by holding the power button then test your codes

If cheat code doesn't work after doing all the steps then the game have DMA. Read the following pointer code tutorials:
