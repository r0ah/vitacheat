# These codes work for both EU version (PCSB00273) and US/AU version (PCSE00229). They also use B200 codes, so they should work regardless of how they were dumped.

## **Notes on hacking this game:**
# This was a particularly good game for learning the differences between single codes, pointers, multilayered pointers and compression. Very simple to find values, but many are pointers, and even more are multilayered.

# The number of Bomb Deflects you've used in a game is stored with a pointer. Simply finding the address will not work, because it resets every time you open the game. Learning to use TempAR to find pointers will get you this code that stays correct even after re-opening the game.

# Points and # of dropped fruits are simple codes stored as 32-bit values (DWORDs). Finding the right address, you can use the code any time, even after closing and re-opening the game.

# Starfruit is stored with a teir 3 pointer. Finding the address, or even the 1st pointer will work until you close the game. You'll have to use TempAR to get an additional 2 pointers and learn the correct syntax to fit all the offsets into a code.

# Number of Bomb Deflect, Berry Blast and Peachy Time items use a simpler teir 2 pointer. All of these addresses use the same pointer, but with a slightly different offset. Because they use similar pointers, we can use pointer compression to condense the 14 lines of code:

# @r0ah , You may add this bit of code as an example to the "Pointer Compression" page if you like. There is no info there at all at the moment, so it's pretty confusing to newbies.
